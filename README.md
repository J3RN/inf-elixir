# inf-elixir

This is a package to allow you to pop open and interact with Elixir REPL (IEx, presently).

## Features
- [x] Run IEx normally (`inf-elixir`)
- [x] Run IEx in a project setting (`inf-elixir-project`)

## TODO
- [ ] Ability to send commands to the inf buffer from a code file (e.g. `inf-elixir-send-line`, `inf-elixir-send-region`, etc)
- [ ] Got a feature you want to see? Open an issue! :smile:
